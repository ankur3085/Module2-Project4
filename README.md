# Module2-Project4
 Create and Mint Token
 # ERC20 Token Contract

## Description

This project implements a basic ERC20 token contract in Solidity. ERC20 is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, widely used for creating tokens with customizable properties like name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply. This contract includes essential functionalities such as transferring tokens between addresses, approving spending allowances, minting new tokens, and burning existing tokens.

### Key Features

- **Token Transfer**: Allows token holders to transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Approval Mechanism**: Enables token holders to approve other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf.
- **Minting**: Provides the capability for the contract owner to mint (create) new tokens and distribute them to specified addresses.
- **Burning**: Allows token holders to burn (destroy) their own tokens, reducing the total supply.

### Usage

- **Installation**: Clone the repository and compile the Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the compiled contract on an Ethereum network using tools like Remix or Hardhat.
- **Interacting with the Contract**: Use Ethereum wallets or scripts to interact with deployed instances of the ERC20 token contract. You can transfer tokens, approve spending allowances, mint new tokens (if allowed), and burn tokens (if implemented).

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
```

### Executing program
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd project-directory
```

Compile the Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler:

```bash
solc MyToken.sol --bin --abi --optimize -o ./build
```

Deploy the compiled contract on an Ethereum network using tools like Remix or Hardhat.
